# 📘 Machine Learning Learning Journey

Welcome to my machine learning journey! 🚀  
This repository is where I’m tracking my progress, experiments, and learnings as I dive into the world of ML.

## 🧠 About This Project

This project contains Jupyter Notebooks where I explore core ML concepts, starting from the basics.  
The goal is to build a solid foundation in machine learning by working through hands-on examples and personal notes.

## 📁 Contents

- `ml_notebook.ipynb`: My first notebook covering [brief summary of what’s inside, e.g., "linear regression using scikit-learn"]
- Future updates: More notebooks coming as I continue learning 📈

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## ✨ Why I'm Doing This

I’m using this repo to:
- Practice and reinforce what I learn
- Track my growth
- Share progress with others
- Build a portfolio of projects

## 📌 Next Steps

- Dive deeper into supervised learning
- Experiment with classification algorithms
- Explore real-world datasets

## 🙌 Contributions & Feedback

I'm learning, so suggestions are welcome!  
Feel free to open an issue or connect with me on GitHub.
